# 🔐 Multisig Configuration for Real Testing

## **✨ Enhanced Test 4: Real Pause/Unpause Operations**

Test 4 now supports **REAL multisig operations** if you provide 2 of the 3 required private keys for your Squads multisig!

## **⚙️ Configuration Steps**

### **1. Get Your Private Keys**

Extract the private keys from your Squads multisig members. These should be 64-element arrays of numbers.

**From Solana CLI:**
```bash
# For each member wallet
solana config get  # Check current keypair path
cat ~/.config/solana/id.json  # Copy the array
```

**From Phantom/Other Wallets:**
- Export private key as byte array format
- Should look like: `[123, 45, 67, 89, ...]` (64 numbers)

### **2. Configure Test 4**

Edit `contract/tests/test-4-pause-unpause.ts` and update the `MULTISIG_CONFIG`:

```typescript
const MULTISIG_CONFIG = {
    // Enable real multisig testing
    ENABLE_REAL_MULTISIG: true,
    
    // Add your 2 member private keys
    MEMBER_1_PRIVATE_KEY: [123, 45, 67, ...], // Your first member's key
    MEMBER_2_PRIVATE_KEY: [89, 12, 34, ...], // Your second member's key
    
    // Your multisig address (already correct)
    MULTISIG_ADDRESS: "BMprzPNF9FTni4mJWwCJnk91ZzhKdxGCx7BwPckMRzBt",
    
    // Required signatures (2 of 3)
    THRESHOLD: 2
};
```

### **3. Run Enhanced Test**

```bash
npm run test-phase-4
```

## **🎯 What Real Testing Includes**

### **🔐 Real Multisig Operations:**
1. ✅ **Actual Pause**: Creates, approves, and executes pause transaction
2. ✅ **Real Blocked Operations**: Tests deposit/bet/credit during actual pause
3. ✅ **Actual Unpause**: Creates, approves, and executes unpause transaction  
4. ✅ **Verified Recovery**: Tests that operations work after unpause

### **📊 Enhanced Results:**
- Real transaction signatures for pause/unpause
- Actual on-chain state verification
- Complete emergency control validation
- Full cycle testing (active → pause → test → unpause → verify)

## **🚨 Safety Notes**

⚠️ **DEVNET ONLY**: This is for devnet testing only
⚠️ **REAL TRANSACTIONS**: These operations will actually pause/unpause the contract
⚠️ **COORDINATION**: Ensure team members know when testing emergency controls
⚠️ **BACKUP**: Have recovery procedures ready

## **🔍 Fallback Mode**

If `ENABLE_REAL_MULTISIG: false`, Test 4 runs in **simulation mode**:
- Tests authority controls (unauthorized/admin blocked)
- Documents the complete Squads workflow
- Simulates pause effects without real operations
- Still validates security model

## **📋 Expected Output (Real Mode)**

🔐 Starting Smart Vault V2 - Phase 4: Pause/Unpause Authority Testing

Step 3: Setting up multisig connection...
   🔑 Loading multisig member keypairs...
   ✅ Member 1: [PublicKey1]
   ✅ Member 2: [PublicKey2]
   ✅ Both members verified in multisig - REAL TESTING ENABLED

Step 7: Performing REAL multisig pause operation...
   📝 Creating pause transaction proposal...
   🏗️  Creating multisig transaction...
   ✅ Member 1 approving transaction...
   ✅ Member 2 approving transaction...
   🚀 Executing pause transaction...
   ✅ PAUSE EXECUTED: [Signature]
   📊 Contract pause state: ⏸️  PAUSED

Step 8: Testing operations during REAL pause state...
   💰 Deposit Test: ✅ Deposit correctly blocked during pause
   🎲 Bet Test: ✅ Bet correctly blocked during pause
   💎 Credit Test: ✅ Credit correctly blocked during pause

Step 9: Performing REAL multisig unpause operation...
   ✅ UNPAUSE EXECUTED: [Signature]
   📊 Contract pause state: ▶️  ACTIVE

Step 10: Testing operations after REAL unpause...
   💰 Deposit Test (Should Work): ✅ Deposit successful: 0.001000 SOL
   💸 Withdraw Test (Should Work): ✅ Withdraw successful: 0.000500 SOL
```

## **🎉 Benefits of Real Testing**

- **Complete Validation**: Tests the entire emergency control system
- **Confidence**: Proves multisig operations work in practice
- **Documentation**: Real transaction signatures for audit trail
- **Security**: Validates that pause actually blocks operations
- **Recovery**: Confirms system can be safely restored
